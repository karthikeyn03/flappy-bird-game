FLAPPY BIRD GAME IN JAVA

* The GOAL of the game is to escape from the PIPES.
* If we press the SPACE BAR it will reset the game
* so when we press the SPACE BAR the bird will JUMPS a bit
* And everytime you PASS a pipe you will GAIN A POINT
* And if you COLLIDE into the pipe, then the GAME WILL OVER.

* And if you press the SPACE BAR AGAIN it will RESET THE GAME AGAIN
